**Instructions:**   This is an open book, open notes, and open Google/internet test.  You may use R on your own computer.  You may use a calculator.

Type your answers to the questions into an Quarto/R Notebook.  Answer the questions in order.  Answer each the question that is asked above your R code chunks.  You must write a sentence containing your answer.  

Your files should have a name in the usual form for the class **lastname_firstname_Stat651_Quiz1.qmd** and **lastname_firstname_Stat651_Quiz1.docx** or **lastname_firstname_Stat651_Quiz1.pdf**.  Submit **both** files in Canvas.

These question is related to the homework from Chapter 3.

For the *RailTrail* dataset from the *mosaicData* R package answer the following questions. The data is from [Northampton, MA](http://northamptonma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/5244/Walk_Bike_Northampton_Existing3416?bidId=).

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(mosaic))
```

1. Create a scatterplot of the *volume* (number of crossing per day) against the *high temperature* that day.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

2. Separate your previous plot into facets by *weekday*.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

3. Examine the plot you have created in the previous question, is there anything about the plot that is unclear?  Suggest a way to fix the issue you have described.  Make a improved plot.

```{r}

```

6. Add regression lines to the four facets.  When does the relationship between *volume* and *hightemp* change?

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

7. (Extra Credit) Compute the slope of each regresion line.  Hint: Use the map function from the **purrr** R package.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

8. Plot *volume* versus each of the following variables: *hightemp*, *lowtemp*, *cloudcover*, *precip*.  Add regression lines.   Put the 4 plots into one ggplot using a function from the **cowplot** R package.

**Answer:**

```{r}

```

9. Export the RailTrail data to a .csv file and load it into the Tableau.

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_csv(RailTrail, "RailTrail.csv")
